# Unit tests for the skill-router medium-lock guard. Pure bash, no jq - same dependency
# stance as the script under test, so the test runs anywhere the hook does.
#
# Each case feeds a synthetic hook payload (the exact shape Claude Code delivers on
# stdin, captured from a real PreToolUse run) to skill-router.sh and asserts the visible
# contract: an allowed load emits nothing, a refused load emits a deny decision. State is
# isolated under a throwaway TMPDIR so a run never touches a real session's lock.
