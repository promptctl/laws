# Unit tests for the skill-router craft-compatibility guard. Pure bash, no jq - same
# dependency stance as the script under test, so the test runs anywhere the hook does.
#
# Each case feeds a synthetic hook payload (the exact shape Claude Code delivers on
# stdin, captured from a real PreToolUse run) to skill-router.sh and asserts the visible
# contract: an allowed load emits nothing, a refused load emits a deny decision. Compatible
# crafts coexist; only an incompatible pairing (today: laws:code + laws:prompt) is refused.
# State is isolated under a throwaway TMPDIR so a run never touches a real session's lock.
